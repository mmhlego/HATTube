You can also read all about enjoying content on &#10; other devices like your television, your games console, or even Google Home.&#10;&#10; --------------------------------------------- Your Service Provider ---------------------------------------------&#10;&#10; The entity providing the Service in the European Economic Area, &#10; and Switzerland is Google Ireland Limited, a company incorporated and operating under the laws of Ireland, &#10; (Registered Number: 368047), located at Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, &#10; Ireland (referred to as “YouTube”, “we”, “us”, or “our”).  References to YouTube’s “Affiliates” in these terms &#10; means the other companies within the Alphabet Inc. corporate group.&#10;&#10; --------------------------------------------- Applicable Terms ---------------------------------------------&#10;&#10; Your use of the Service is subject to these terms, the YouTube Community Guidelines and the Policy, &#10; Safety and Copyright Policies (when you accept, together these terms form the &quot;Agreement&quot;). &#10; Your Agreement with us will also include the Advertising on YouTube Policies if you provide advertising &#10; or sponsorships to the Service or incorporate paid promotions in your Content.&#10;&#10; Please read this Agreement carefully and make sure you understand it. &#10; If you do not understand the Agreement, or do not accept any part of it, &#10; then you may not use the Service.&#10;&#10; --------------------------------------------- Age Requirements ---------------------------------------------&#10;&#10; You may use the Service if you are at least 15 years old; however, children of all ages may use the &#10; Service and YouTube Kids (where available) if enabled by a parent or legal guardian.&#10;&#10; --------------------------------------- Permission by Parent or Guardian -------------------------------------&#10;&#10; If you are under 18, you must have your parent or legal guardian’s permission to use the Service.

You can find tools and resources to help you manage &#10; your family’s experience on YouTube (including how to enable a child under the age of 15 to use the Service &#10; and YouTube Kids) in our Help Center and through Google’s Family Link.&#10;&#10; --------------------------------------------- Businesses ---------------------------------------------&#10;&#10; If you are using the Service on behalf of a company or organisation, you confirm to us that you &#10; have authority to act on behalf of that entity, and that entity accepts this Agreement.&#10;&#10;  --------------------------------------------- Content on the Service ---------------------------------------------&#10;     &#10; The content on the Service includes videos, audio (for example music and other sounds), graphics, photos, &#10; text (such as comments and scripts), branding (including trade names, trademarks, service marks, or logos), &#10; interactive features, software, metrics, and other materials (collectively, &quot;Content”). Content may be provided &#10; to the Service and distributed by our users and YouTube is a provider of hosting services for such Content. &#10; Content is the responsibility of the person or entity that provides it to the Service. If you see any Content you &#10; believe does not comply with these terms, such as by violating the Community Guidelines or the law, you can &#10; report it to us.&#10;&#10; Google Accounts and YouTube Channels&#10; You can use parts of the Service, such as browsing and searching for Content, without having &#10; a Google account. However, you do need a Google account to use some features. With a Google account, &#10; you may be able to like videos, subscribe to channels, create your own YouTube channel, and more. You can &#10; follow these instructions to create a Google account.&#10;&#10; Creating a YouTube channel will give you access to additional features and functions, such as uploading &#10; videos,making comments or creating playlists. Here are some details about how to create your own YouTube &#10; channel.&#10;&#10; To protect your Google account, keep your password confidential. You should not reuse your Google &#10; account password on third-party applications. Learn more about keeping your Google account secure, &#10; including what to do if you learn of any unauthorised use of your password or Google account.&#10;&#10; Your Information&#10; Our Privacy Policy explains how we treat your personal data and protect your privacy when you use the &#10; Service. The YouTube Kids Privacy Notice provides additional information about our privacy practices that &#10; are specific to YouTube Kids.&#10;&#10; We will process any audio or audiovisual content uploaded by you to the Service in accordance with the &#10; YouTube Data Processing Terms, except in cases where you uploaded such content for personal purposes &#10; or household activities. Learn More.&#10;&#10; Permissions and Restrictions&#10; You may access and use the Service as made available to you, as long as you comply with this Agreement &#10; and the law. You may view or listen to Content for your personal, non-commercial use. You may also show &#10; YouTube videos through the embeddable YouTube player.&#10;&#10; The following restrictions apply to your use of the Service. You are not allowed to:&#10;&#10; access, reproduce, download, distribute, transmit, broadcast, display, sell, license, alter, modify or &#10; otherwise use any part of the Service or any Content except: (a) as specifically permitted by the Service;  &#10; (b) with prior written permission from YouTube and, if applicable, the respective rights holders; or (c) &#10; as permitted by applicable law;&#10; circumvent, disable, fraudulently engage, or otherwise interfere with the Service (or attempt to do any of &#10; these things), including security-related features or features that: (a) prevent or restrict the copying or &#10; other use of Content; or (b) limit the use of the Service or Content;&#10; access the Service using any automated means (such as robots, botnets or scrapers) except: (a) in the case &#10; of public search engines, in accordance with YouTube’s robots.txt file; (b) with YouTube’s prior written &#10; permission; or (c) as permitted by applicable law;&#10; collect or use any information that might identify a person (for example, harvesting usernames or faces), &#10; unless permitted by that person or allowed under section 3 above;&#10; use the Service to distribute unsolicited promotional or commercial content or other unwanted or mass &#10; solicitations (spam);&#10; cause or encourage any inaccurate measurements of genuine user engagement with the Service, &#10; including by paying people or providing them with incentives to increase a video’s views, likes, or &#10; dislikes, or to increase a channel’s subscribers, or otherwise manipulate metrics;&#10; misuse any reporting, flagging, complaint, dispute, or appeals process, including by making groundless, &#10; vexatious, or frivolous submissions;&#10; run contests on or through the Service that do not comply with YouTube’s contest policies and guidelines;&#10; use the Service to view or listen to Content other than for personal, non-commercial use (for example, &#10; you may not publicly screen videos or stream music from the Service); or&#10; use the Service to: (a) sell any advertising, sponsorships, or promotions placed on, around, or within the &#10; Service or Content, other than those allowed in the Advertising on YouTube policies (such as compliant &#10; product placements); or (b) sell advertising, sponsorships, or promotions on any page of any website or &#10; application that only contains Content from the Service or where Content from the Service is the primary &#10; basis for such sales (for example, selling ads on a webpage where YouTube videos are the only content of &#10; value).&#10; Reservation&#10; Any right not expressly granted to you in this Agreement remains the right of YouTube or the respective &#10; rights holders. This means, for example, that using the Service does not give you ownership of any &#10; intellectual property rights in the Content you access (including any branding used on or displayed in the &#10; Service).&#10;&#10; Changes to the Service&#10; YouTube is constantly changing and improving the Service. We may also need to alter or discontinue the &#10; Service, or any part of it, in order to make performance or security improvements, change functionality and &#10; features, make changes to comply with law, or prevent illegal activities on or abuse of our systems. We will &#10; always consider and balance the impact of such changes on the use of the Service. Whenever reasonably &#10; possible, we will provide notice when we discontinue or make material changes to our Service that will &#10; have an adverse impact on the use of our Service. However, there will be times when we need to make &#10; such changes without notice, such as where we need to take action to improve the security and operability &#10; of our Service, prevent abuse, or meet our legal requirements. &#10;&#10; Your Content and Conduct&#10; Uploading Content&#10; If you have a YouTube channel, you may be able to upload Content to the Service. You may use your &#10; Content to promote your business or artistic enterprise. If you choose to upload Content, you must not&#10; submit to the Service any Content that does not comply with this Agreement or the law. For example, &#10; the Content you submit must not include third-party intellectual property (such as copyrighted material) &#10; unless you have permission from that party or are otherwise legally entitled to do so (including by way of &#10; any available exceptions or limitations to copyright or related rights provided for in European Union law). &#10; You are legally responsible for the Content you submit to the Service. We may use automated systems that&#10; analyze your Content to help detect infringement and abuse, such as spam, malware, and illegal content.&#10;&#10; Rights you Grant&#10; You retain all of your ownership rights in your Content. In short, what belongs to you stays yours. However, &#10; we do require you to grant certain rights to YouTube and other users of the Service, as described below.&#10;&#10; Licence to YouTube&#10; By providing Content to the Service, you grant to YouTube a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, &#10; transferable, sublicensable licence to use that Content, the right  to reproduce, host, make technical copies, &#10; distribute, modify, display, analyze, make publicly available and perform it for the purpose of operating, &#10; promoting, and improving the Service.&#10;&#10; Licence to Other Users&#10;  You also grant each other user of the Service a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free licence to access your &#10; Content through the Service, and to use that Content (including to reproduce, distribute, modify, display, &#10; and perform it) only as enabled by a feature of the Service.&#10;&#10; Duration of Licence&#10; The licences granted by you continue until the Content is removed as described below. Once removed, the &#10; licences will terminate, except where the operation of the Service, use of Content permitted before your &#10; removal, or the law requires otherwise.  For example, removal of Content by you does not require &#10; YouTube to: (a) recall Content that is being used by other users within any limited offline viewing &#10; functionality of the Service; or (b) delete copies we reasonably need to keep for legal purposes.&#10;&#10; Right to Monetize&#10; You grant to YouTube the right to monetize your Content on the Service (and such monetization may &#10; include displaying ads on or within Content or charging users a fee for access). This Agreement does not &#10; entitle you to any payments. Starting June 1, 2021, any payments you may be entitled to receive from &#10; YouTube under any other agreement between you and YouTube (including for example payments under &#10; the YouTube Partner Program, Channel memberships or Super Chat) will be treated as royalties.  &#10; If required by law, Google will withhold taxes from such payments.&#10;&#10; Removing Your Content&#10; You may remove your Content from the Service at any time. You also have the option to make a copy of &#10; your Content before removing it. You must remove your Content if you no longer have the rights &#10; required by these terms.&#10;&#10; Removal of Content By YouTube&#10; If there are objective and concrete reason to believe that any Content is in breach of this Agreement or may&#10; cause harm to YouTube, our users, or third parties, we may remove or take down some or all of such &#10; Content. We will notify you with the reason for our action unless there are objective and concrete reason&#10; to believe that to do so: (a) would violate the law or the direction of a legal enforcement authority, &#10; or would otherwise risk legal liability for YouTube or our Affiliates; (b) would compromise an investigation &#10; or the integrity or operation of the Service; or (c) would cause harm to any user, other third party, &#10; YouTube or our Affiliates. You can learn more about reporting and enforcement, including how to appeal &#10; on the Troubleshooting page of our Help Center.&#10;&#10; Copyright Protection&#10; We provide information to help copyright holders manage their intellectual property online in our YouTube &#10; Copyright Center. If you believe your copyright has been infringed on the Service, please send us a notice.&#10;&#10; We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement according to the process in our YouTube &#10; Copyright Center, where you can also find information about how to resolve a copyright strike. YouTube's &#10; policies provide for the termination, in appropriate circumstances, of repeat infringers’ access to the Service.&#10;&#10; Account Suspension and Termination&#10; Terminations by You&#10; You may stop using the Service at any time. You can also delete the Service from your Google Account, &#10; which involves closing your YouTube channel and removing your data, with the option to download a copy &#10; of your data first. &#10;&#10; Terminations and Suspensions by YouTube for Cause&#10; YouTube may suspend or terminate your access, your Google account, or your Google account’s access to &#10; all or part of the Service if: (a) you materially or repeatedly breach this Agreement; (b) we are required to do&#10; so to comply with a legal requirement or a court order; or (c) we reasonably believe there has been conduct &#10; that creates liability or harm to any user, other third party, YouTube or our Affiliates.&#10;&#10; Terminations by YouTube for Service Changes&#10; YouTube may terminate your access, or your Google account’s access to all or part of the Service if YouTube &#10; reasonably believes that its provision of the Service to you is no longer commercially viable. &#10;&#10; Notice for Termination or Suspension&#10; We will notify you with the reason for termination or suspension by YouTube unless there is an objective &#10; and concrete reason to believe that to do so: (a) would violate the law or the direction of a legal &#10; enforcement authority, or would otherwise risk legal liability for YouTube or our Affiliates; (b) would &#10; compromise an investigation or the integrity or operation of the Service; or (c) would cause harm to any &#10; user, other third party, YouTube or our Affiliates. Where YouTube is terminating your access for Service &#10; Changes, where reasonably possible, you will be provided with sufficient time to export your Content &#10; from the Service.&#10;&#10; Effect of Account Suspension or Termination&#10; If your Google account is terminated or your Google account’s access to the Service is restricted, you may &#10; continue using certain aspects of the Service (such as viewing only) without an account, and this &#10; Agreement will continue to apply to such use. If you believe your Google account has been terminated &#10; in error, you can appeal using this form.&#10;&#10; About Software in our Service&#10; Downloadable Software&#10; When the Service requires or includes downloadable software (such as the YouTube Studio application), &#10; you give permission for that software to update automatically on your device once a new version or feature &#10; is available, subject to your device settings. Unless that software is governed by additional terms which &#10; provide a licence, YouTube gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive &#10; licence to use the software provided to you by YouTube as part of the Service. This licence is for the sole &#10; purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Service as provided by YouTube, in the manner &#10; permitted by this Agreement. You are not allowed to copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of the &#10; software, or to reverse-engineer or attempt to extract the source code of that software, unless laws prohibit &#10; these restrictions or you have YouTube’s written permission.&#10;&#10; Open Source&#10; Some software used in our Service may be offered under an open source licence. There may be provisions in &#10; an open source licence that expressly override some of these terms.  If so, we will make that open source &#10; licence available to you.&#10;&#10; Other Legal Terms&#10; Warranty&#10; We provide the Service with reasonable care and skill.&#10;&#10; Disclaimer&#10; By law, consumers have certain rights that cannot be excluded or altered by a contract. Nothing in this &#10; Agreement affects those rights you may have as a consumer. Other than as expressly stated in this &#10; Agreement or as required by law, YouTube does not make any specific promises about the Service. &#10; For example, we don’t make any promises about: the Content provided through the Service; the specific &#10; features of the Service, or its accuracy, reliability, availability, or ability to meet your needs; or that any &#10; Content you submit will be accessible or stored on the Service.&#10;&#10; Limitation of Liability&#10; All users: Nothing in this Agreement is intended to exclude or limit any party’s liability for: death or &#10; personal injury; fraud; fraudulent misrepresentation; or any liability that cannot be excluded or limited &#10; by law.&#10;&#10; To the extent permitted by applicable law, YouTube and its Affiliates will not be responsible for:&#10;&#10; losses that were not caused by YouTube or its Affiliates’ breach of this Agreement;&#10; any loss or damage that was not, at the time that this Agreement was formed between you and YouTube, &#10; a reasonably foreseeable consequence of YouTube or its Affiliates breaching this Agreement; or&#10; the Content submitted by any user, or for the defamatory, offensive, or illegal conduct of any user.&#10; Business Users only: If you are using the Service for the purpose of your trade, business, craft or profession, &#10; (a “Business User”), to the extent permitted by applicable law, the following limitations of liability will also &#10; apply:&#10;&#10; YouTube and its Affiliates will not be responsible for lost profits, revenues, or data; loss of opportunity or &#10; anticipated savings; indirect or consequential losses, or punitive damages (in all cases whether such losses &#10; were foreseeable or not); and&#10; YouTube and its Affiliates’ total liability for any claims arising from or relating to the Service is limited to &#10; the greater of: (a) the amount of revenue that YouTube has paid to you from your use of the Service in &#10; the 12 months before the date of your notice, in writing to YouTube, of the claim and (b) €500, &#10; whichever is higher.&#10;&#10; Third-Party Links&#10; The Service may contain links to third-party websites and online services that are not owned or controlled &#10; by YouTube. YouTube has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, such websites and online &#10; services. Be aware when you leave the Service; we suggest you read the terms and privacy policy of each &#10; third-party website and online service that you visit.&#10;&#10; About this Agreement&#10; Modifying this Agreement&#10; We may modify this Agreement, for example, to reflect changes to our Service or for legal, regulatory, or &#10; security reasons. YouTube will provide reasonable advance notice of any material modifications to this &#10; Agreement and the opportunity to review these changes. However, changes addressing newly available &#10; features of the Service or changes made for legal reasons may be effective immediately. Changes will only &#10; apply going forward. If you do not agree to the modified terms, you should remove any Content you &#10; uploaded and discontinue your use of the Service.&#10;&#10; Continuation of this Agreement&#10; If your use of the Service ends, the following terms of this Agreement will continue to apply to you: &#10; “Other Legal Terms”, “About This Agreement”, and the licenses granted by you will continue in limited cases &#10; as described under “Duration of License”.&#10;&#10; Severance&#10; If it turns out that a particular term of this Agreement is not enforceable for any reason, this will not affect &#10; any other terms, unless otherwise provided by law.&#10;&#10; Assignment&#10; YouTube may transfer all or part of this Agreement to an Affiliate or, if YouTube is sold, to a third party, &#10; where such a transfer does not have the effect of reducing your rights without your consent.&#10;&#10; No Waiver&#10; If you do not comply with this Agreement and we do not take action immediately, this doesn’t mean that &#10; we are giving up any rights that we may have (such as the right to take action in the future).&#10;&#10; Governing Law&#10;  If you live in the European Economic Area, or Switzerland, this Agreement, and your relationship with &#10;  YouTube under this Agreement, will be governed by the laws of your country of residence, and legal &#10;  proceedings may be brought in your local courts." wrapText="true" />
